# CSS Arena â€“ Task 3: News Page (Topbar, Sidebar, and Content)

## Task

Create a CSS file `styles.css` to implement the layout and design of the following webpage, which focuses on the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence.

> ðŸ§± The HTML structure is already provided in `index.html` and **must not be modified**.

### Design Requirements:

<img src="ziel-1.png" alt="Target view of the webpage 1" />
<img src="ziel-2.png" alt="Target view of the webpage 2" />

### Specifications:

- A **sticky** header with two icons (one on the left and one on the right)
- An **article section** on the left side with a large headline and an image
  - The article should include a concise introduction and multiple paragraphs about Artificial Intelligence
- A **sidebar** on the right displaying a list of related articles
- All elements should have **rounded corners** and a cohesive design with a clear structure
- Font: Manrope
- Page background color: light gray (`#eee`)
- Pay attention to **spacing, font sizes, and hover effects**:
  - Sidebar links should be underlined on hover
  - Icons in the top bar should change background color on hover

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Focus on **responsive design** to ensure the page looks good on smaller devices. Use `max-width`, `padding`, and `margin` to distribute content effectively.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
